If you'd like to contribute to the design system, we'd love to have your help.
As with any open source project, we ask that you be nice, professional, and
courteous towards others.

Contributing doesn't necessarily mean commiting code, we also encourage you to:

- Open issues
- Join in on discussions in issues and PRs
- Help write documentation
- Use the Design System in your project and provide feedback

### Local Development

To contribute code to the Design System, first you'll need to set it up for
local development.

### Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pricelinelabs/design-system.git
cd design-system
```

### Lerna and Rollup

This repository uses [Lerna][] & [Rollup][] and is set up as a monorepo, with
multiple npm packages in the `packages/` folder.

[lerna]: https://lernajs.io
[rollup]: https://rollupjs.org

### Install dependencies

In the root directory, use `npm install` command to install dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

Please be mindful that any deletion, or edit, of `package-lock.json`
would cause issue in dependencies of packages within the design system.

### Running tests

We use [Jest][jest] for testing, including unit tests for functionality and
[snapshot testing][snapshots] for components.

```sh
npm test
```

To run tests in watch mode (useful for TDD):

```sh
npm test -- --watch
```

If you make intentional changes to an existing component, you will need to
update its snapshot:

```sh
npm test -- -u
```

### Storybook

We use [Storybook][storybook] for isolated UI component development.
To run storybook locally from the root directory:

```sh
npm start
open http://localhost:8000/
```

- Storybook stories are in the following directories:
  - `packages/core/storybook`
  - `packages/slider/storybook`

### Publishing

To publish the packages to npm, you'll need to be added as an owner for the
packages you're publishing. Use the #design-system Slack channel for more
information.

These Lerna commands can be helpful when publishing:

- Run `npm run changed` to see which packages have changed since the last
  release.
- Run `npm run diff` to see a diff of all packages since the last release.
- Run `npm run publish` to publish the updated packages with Lerna.

### Static Docs Site

Markdown and source code for the [docs site][] are
located in `docs/`.

To run the static docs locally:

```sh
cd docs
npm install
npm start
```

### Troubleshooting

You may run into the following error `ERROR in ./icons.json` when running
storybook. The problem occur when the icons.json is not built yet. Running
`npm run prepare` should fix the problem.

### GitHub Flow

We follow a loose version of [GitHub Flow][github-flow] where feature branches
are created from master, submitted as pull requests, given time for review and
discussion, then merged into master.

All merges into master should be ready to be published to npm and the person
merging the PR should use `npm version` to bump the package's version according
to [Semantic Versioning][semver].

Generally the workflow looks like this:

1. Pull the latest changes from master
2. Create a new feature branch (pick a name that clearly describes the feature)
3. Commit changes to your feature branch (smaller commits with clear messages
   are best)
4. Push your branch to origin
5. Open a Pull Request with a clear description of the change (Answering
   _what_, _why_, and _how_ is a good place to start)
6. Allow for some time for discussion
7. (optional) If your PR has merge conflicts, pull the latest from master, then
   merge those changes into your PR branch, resolving conflicts in the process
8. Once there is a general consensus on the change and all tests have passed,
   merge the PR into master
9. Use the npm CLI to appropriately version and publish the package
10. Push the git tags created with the npm CLI to GitHub with `git push --tags`

### Beta Version

As of the date this was written, the Design System is currently in a beta.
The package versioning reflects this with the version `1.0.0-x` convention.
Once the library is in a more stable and mature state, we will release a stable
`1.0.0` and strictly follow semantic versioning from that point on.

### Pull Requests

All changes to the code base should be reviewed in a PR before merging to
master. This gives contributors and the team a chance to review and discuss
changes and helps create a record of the project's history.

If you're unsure about your change, feel free to open a PR for discussion or
make an RFC (request for comments) PR. PRs can also be in a work in progress
(WIP) state as long as they are clearly marked.

Generally follow these rules for creating a PR:

- Keep it simple
- Keep changes as small as possible
- Write tests for changes & try to maintain 100% code coverage
- Write documentation for changes
- For new components, add stories to Storybook
- Announce your PR to the appropriate channels in Slack
- Allow for enough time for everyone to review and discuss your PR
- Remember that not every PR will be merged, but that's okay
