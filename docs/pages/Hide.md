# Hide

Conditionally hides content based on viewport width.

**Extends: [Box](/Box)**

This component's props work differently than other mobile-first min-width
media queries since it's often useful to hide an element only at certain breakpoints.

Hidden below the first breakpoint

```.jsx
<Hide xs>
  Hide xs
</Hide>
```

Hidden at large breakpoints

```.jsx
<Hide lg xl>
  Hide lg xl
</Hide>
```

Hidden when printing

```.jsx
<Hide print>
  Hide for printing
</Hide>
```
